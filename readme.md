# Ben's iPhone remote control

I have two TVs in my living room and often watch two sporting events at the same time. I made this to automate the audio switching as well as to manage more than two events with PIP. (though PIP is broken now that I switched from Brave to Firefox).  

This is not at all deployable for someone else since it is dependant on your browser settings and many other factors  

I hope to improve this app in the future
